    Execute a Qiskit quantum circuit and calculate the expectation value of the Z operator
    on the 0th qubit.

    This function measures all qubits in the circuit, simulates the circuit on the specified
    backend, and calculates the expectation value of the Z operator on the first qubit
    based on the measurement outcomes.

    Args:
        circuit (QuantumCircuit): The quantum circuit to execute.
        backend (Backend): The Qiskit backend to run the circuit on.
        shots (int): The number of measurement shots to use.
        noise_model (NoiseModel | None, optional): An optional noise model to simulate.
            If provided, the circuit will be simulated with the specified noise model.

    Returns:
        float: The expectation value of the Z operator on the 0th qubit.

    Notes:
        - Qiskit follows little-endian ordering for qubits. The outcome bitstrings
          are reversed during processing to ensure correct calculations.
        - The function assumes that the input circuit does not already contain measurement
          operations, as it adds measurement gates to all qubits in the circuit.
